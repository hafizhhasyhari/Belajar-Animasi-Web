#### We Use the fork-and-pull method, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo to your account.
2. create your branch from `master`
3. clone the repo into your local directory using **git clone** in your git bash.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. **commit** your changes and **push** your work back to your fork
